        supplement their efforts.<br><br>

        ☺ <u>Being aware and knowledgable about human trafficking</u>- It's very important to be aware of your surroundings and to understand that you could be the next victim. Being educated on signs that indicate someone could be a victim of human trafficking increases the likelihood of that person getting help and gives a voice to victims who do not feel comfortable speaking out for themselves. If you are in the 
        United States and believe that someone may be a victim of human trafficking, report your suspicions to law enforcement by calling 911 or the 24-hour National Human Trafficking Hotline line at <u>1-888-373-7888</u>. Make sure to report any suspicious activities you see in your area.<br> <br>

          ☺ <u>Advocate and raise awareness</u>- Meet with or reach out to local, state, and federal representatives to inform them about fighting human trafficking. This will help bring the issue to their attention, which increases the likelihood that 
          actions will be taken. In addition to bringing attention to trafficking to the authorities, it is important to also raise awareness about this issue to
          the people it can affect. Raising awareness prompts greater support from the people for the movement against
          trafficking and encourages more people to join the fight.<br><br>

               ☺ <u>Helping survivors</u>- Donate clothes and other goods to shelters and organizations that support victims of human trafficking. Also, offer job to victims so that they can start fresh and build their new life.
        Victims who recieve help and aid are more likely to recover and avoid being trafficked ever again. <br><br>

            ☺ <u>Report suspicious activity</u>- It is important to know the resources available to you and to be conscious of your surroundings. Whether in your usual surroundings, 
          travelling abroad, or all the situations in between, be aware of your surroundings and know where to get help when needed. Also, keep the emergency phone number of the given country on hand
          to enable quick contact should you see any suspicious behavior.
