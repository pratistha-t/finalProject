    </h2>
    <p class="p-human">
Article 3, paragraph (a) of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons defines Trafficking in Persons as 
the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, 
of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments 
or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. 
Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, 
forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs.    </p>

      How to recognize it
    </h3>
    <p class="p2-human">
Recognizing potential red flags and knowing the indicators of human trafficking is a key step in identifying more victims and 
helping them find the assistance they need.

Bear in mind that not all indictators will be present in all situations. The type of trafficking and the content or environment are all 
important to take into account.

      nor should be taken as “proof” that human trafficking is occurring. Additionally, cultural differences should also be considered.

        How to avoid it
    </h4>
    <p class="p3-human">
The key to not being targeted is to not allow yourself to look like a victim.  How you carry yourself and present yourself to the world 
is a primary factor in the traffickers selection process.  Take a look at the list below to see the big items that will keep you from 
being trafficked. <br><br>

- Maintain situational awareness – especially during transitions.  
Keep head out of your phone. Look around and be sure to look into peoples eyes. <br>
- Walk with purpose, head up shoulders back, look like you are ready for a fight, be confident and assertive, hands empty if possible.<br>
- Take a self defense class/classes. Preferably study a martial art. Boxing / kick boxing / BJJ / Muay Thai. Etc.<br>
- Carry a bright flashlight to check in dark areas, alleys, and to have at the ready in dark places. They can also be used as an impact weapon.<br>
- Carry a folding tactical knife. Know how to use it and practice opening quickly. Understand that it is classified as a lethal weapon.<br>
- Carry a less than lethal weapon of some type. Pepper spray, taser, baton, tactical umbrella etc. But you must practice with them and 
know how to use them. <br>
- Get a concealed carry license and carry a firearm. Train with it monthly as a minimum. Know your use of force laws in your state.<br>
- Be especially weary in nightclubs, resort towns, in dark parking lots, driving in bad parts of town. <br>
- When out at bars keep control of your drinks. Do not leave them sit unattended while you go dancing. <br>
- Don’t drink to excess. Eat a good full meal before you drink.  Alternate one alcoholic drink for 2 glasses of water. 
  Always go out with at least three people and don’t split up! <br>
- Do not use recreational drugs from unknown suppliers, especially when on vacation or out at night clubs.<br>
- Never get in a vehicle with someone you just met. For any reason no matter how nice they seem! Call for an Uber or Cab or Lyft. 
  Make sure the driver and car matches the description in the app. <br>
- Never allow young girls between the ages of 15 to 23 travel abroad alone. This age range of young women are at the highest risk 
  of being inducted into sex slavery.<br>
- Avoid vacations in places that have recently experienced civil war, ethnic cleansing, mass genocide, etc.<br>
- Avoid areas that are in economic crisis, politically unstable, etc.    </p>
